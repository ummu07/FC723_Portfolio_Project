# FC723 Portfolio Project 1: Euclidean Algorithm

## Description
This project is developed as part of the FC723 Programming Theory module. It implements the **Euclidean Algorithm** to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers without using Python's built-in libraries.

An additional feature checks whether the two numbers are **relatively prime** (i.e., if their GCD is 1).

## How to Run the Program
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python3 FC723.py
```

4. Enter two positive integers when prompted.

## Example Usage
```
Enter the first positive integer: 15
Enter the second positive integer: 28
The GCD of 15 and 28 is 1.
The numbers are relatively prime.
```
